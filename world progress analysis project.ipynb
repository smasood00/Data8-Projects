    "**Deadline.** This project is due at 11:59pm on Friday 10/4. Projects will be accepted up to 2 days (48 hours) late; a project submitted less than 24 hours after the deadline will receive 2/3 credit, a project submitted between 24 and 48 hours after the deadline will receive 1/3 credit, and a project submitted 48 hours or more after the deadline will receive no credit. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.** For full credit, you must also complete the first 8 questions, pass all public autograder tests, and submit to okpy by 11:59pm on Friday 9/27. After you've submitted the checkpoint, you may still change your answers before the project deadline - only your final submission will be graded for correctness. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner; your partner must be from your assigned lab section. Only one of you is required to submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org), the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](http://data8.org/fa19/staff.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** The tests that are given are **not comprehensive** and passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work! You might want to create your own checks along the way to see if your answers make sense. Additionally, before you submit, make sure that none of your cells take a very long time to run (several minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Free Response Questions:** Make sure that you put the answers to the written questions in the indicated cell we provide. Check to make sure that you have a [Gradescope](http://gradescope.com) account, which is where the scores to the free response questions will be posted. If you do not, make sure to reach out to your assigned (u)GSI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. For example, in Question 1 of the Global Poverty section, we ask you to assign an answer to `latest`. Do not reassign the variable name `latest` to anything else in your notebook, otherwise there is the chance that our tests grade against what `latest` was reassigned to.\n",
    "\n",
    "You **never** have to use just one line in this project or any others. Use intermediate variables and multiple lines as much as you would like!  \n",

    "This graph of life expectancy does not directly explain the decreased population growth rate from 1985 to 2010. However, it does offer some insight as to why the growth rate decreased. According to the graph, people in Bangladesh are living longer as time goes on. Since life extpectancy is higher, this may eliminate a need for having more children which may point to why the growth rate is decreasing. But this graph does not directly tell the story as to why the growth rate decreased. When analyzing graphs like this, we can only draw on inferences and outside knowledge to explain major changes in the data. Major events like the 1991 Cyclone that killed over 100,000 people in Bangladesh does not directly explain the overall change in population growth rate."

    "**Question 5.** Write a function `fertility_over_time` that takes the Alpha-3 code of a `country` and a `start` year. It returns a two-column table with labels `Year` and `Children per woman` that can be used to generate a line chart of the country's fertility rate each year, starting at the `start` year. The plot should include the `start` year and all later years that appear in the `fertility` table. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in the next cell, call your `fertility_over_time` function on the Alpha-3 code for Bangladesh and the year 1970 in order to plot how Bangladesh's fertility rate has changed since 1970. Note that the function `fertility_over_time` should not return the plot itself. **The expression that draws the line plot is provided for you; please don't change it.**\n",

The link has been attributed to family planning: if parents can expect that their children will all survive into adulthood, then they will choose to have fewer children. We can see if this association is evident in Bangladesh by plotting the relationship between total fertility rate and [child mortality rate per 1000 children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_mortality)."

    "**Question 11.** Create a function `stats_for_year` that takes a `year` and returns a table of statistics. The table it returns should have four columns: `geo`, `population_total`, `children_per_woman_total_fertility`, and `child_mortality_under_5_per_1000_born`. Each row should contain one Alpha-3 country code and three statistics: population, fertility rate, and child mortality for that `year` from the `population`, `fertility` and `child_mortality` tables. Only include rows for which all three statistics are available for the country and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, restrict the result to country codes that appears in `big_50`, an array of the 50 most populous countries in 2010. This restriction will speed up computations later in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you write `stats_for_year`, try calling `stats_for_year` on any year between 1960 and 2010. Try to understand the output of stats_for_year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: The tests for this question are quite comprehensive, so if you pass the tests, your function is probably correct. However, without calling your function yourself and looking at the output, it will be very difficult to understand any problems you have, so try your best to write the function correctly and check that it works before you rely on the `ok` tests to confirm your work.\n",
